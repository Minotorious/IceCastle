# IceCastle
A snowy Ice Castle set comprised of multiple ramparts in various angles to build exquisite fantasy castles!

More parts and decoratives will be added over time and I am always open for suggestions!

**Important Note: This mod is mutually exclusive with Winter Wonderland, if one loads the second in the list will not load!**
